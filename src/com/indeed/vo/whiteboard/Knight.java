Given an infinite chessboard, find minimum no. of steps for a knight to reach from the origin to (x, y).

Accepted solution: Bidirectional BFS.
There's also constant time solution.

Follow-up:
A list of forbidden coordinates are introduced where knight canâ€™t reach. Handle this in your code. Make sure the infinite loop is handled since the board is infinite.

Suppose if branching factor of tree is b and distance of goal vertex from source is d, then the normal BFS/DFS searching complexity would be O(bexp(d)).
 On the other hand, if we execute two search operation then the complexity would be O(bd/2) for each search and total complexity would be O(b exp(d/2 )+ b exp(d/2))
  which is far less than O(bd).
