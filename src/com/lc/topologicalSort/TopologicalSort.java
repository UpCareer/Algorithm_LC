/**
 * Many real world situations can be modeled as a graph with directed edges where some events must occur before others,
 * for instance:
 *
 * 1. program build dependencies
 * 2. college class prerequisites
 * 3. event scheduling
 * 4. Assembly instructions
 *
 * A topological ordering is an ordering of the nodes in a directed graph where for each directed edge from node A to
 * node B, node A appears before node B in the ordering.
 *
 * Kahn's algorithm is a simple topological sort algorithm can find a topological ordering in O(V+E) time !
 *
 * only certain types of graphs have a topological orderings. These are Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
 *
 * A directed acyclic graph is a finite directed graph with no directed cycles
