 * Problem 1: Can we solve the above problem in O(1) space and without modifying the input array ?
 *
 * Solution: while doing the cyclic sort, we realized that the array will have a cycle due to the duplicate number
 * and that the start of the cycle will always point to the duplicate number. This means that we can use the fast &
 * the slow pointer method to find the duplicate number or the start of the cycle similar to start of LinkedList Cycle
